Trove is a major national digitisation, discovery, and aggregation project for resources relating to Australia, created and maintained by the National Library of Australia. It brings together content from libraries, museums, archives and other research organisations and gives users tools to explore and build. Trove is many things: a community, a set of services, an aggregation of metadata, and a growing repository of fulltext digital resources.
