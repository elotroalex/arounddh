Aluka is an international collaborative working to build a “digital library of scholarly resources from and about Africa.” Aluka is part of JSTOR, and is freely available in Africa. While the site is a scholarly resource with many submissions aimed at being used in the undergraduate classroom, materials are valuable to secondary and graduate students as well. Work began in 2003 with a site launch in 2006. It became a part of JSTOR in 2008.

Organizations that have joined Aluka may contribute to the collection, thereby gaining a larger audience for their materials. The goal is to bring together and raise visibility of the holdings of any institution with African holdings. Current holdings fall into two categories [African Cultural Heritage Sites](http://www.aluka.org/page/content/heritage.jsp) and [Landscapes and Struggles for Freedom in Southern Africa](http://www.aluka.org/page/content/struggles.jsp). Both have been curated by local and international experts to ensure the quality of included materials which range across a many media from travelogues to oral histories to maps to excavation reports to scholarly research.
