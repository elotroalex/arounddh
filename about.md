Project Introduction
Around DH in 80 Days is a multi-institutional, interdisciplinary Digital Humanities collaboration that seeks to introduce new and veteran audiences to the global field of DH scholarly practice by bringing together current DH projects from around the world.

Upon the initial live launch of Around DH, a different DH project from around the globe will be featured on our site each day for 80 days, offering audiences a unique opportunity to meaningfully engage the international, interdisciplinary, multimodal work being done by the digital humanities community, broadly conceived. 

On Reading Around DH in 80 Days
Around DH is intended as a first step toward discovering current and developing DH projects across the globe. That is, where we hope that you will see Around DH as a valuable resource for encountering the broader, global field of DH and its diverse practices, we also hope this project will invite you to seek out the critical work of DH beyond the familiar by continuing to engage with these and other projects beyond our platform. 

The choices for inclusion were made by several editors working in collaboration with the main editor. We hope that you do not see absences as indications that we do not value your project. At some point our friend Barbara Bordalejo quipped that we should have the "1,001 nights of digital humanities" instead, and she was right, of course. We hope that you take these selections only as an opening gesture, while we gather the army of collaborators that it would take to do 1,001 of these.   

Each project on Around DH is provided with a brief description of the project. In most cases we copy the language by which the project describes itself, with few editorial interventions. 

The Story Behind Around DH in 80 Days
In the Fall of 2013, Alex Gil started sending out daily emails to his colleagues at the Humanities and History Division of the Columbia University Libraries with 

proposed the Around DH in 80 Days as a collaboration project to a group of World History and English Literature graduate students enrolled in Ryan Cordell’s (Northeastern University, NU Lab for Texts, Maps, and Networks) graduate studies seminar, “Doing Digital Humanities,” an introductory course to the Digital Humanities at Northeastern University. New to the field of Digital Humanities and excited by Alex's vision to advance a global perspective to Digital Humanities scholarship, these graduate students decided to take on the initial research and design of Around DH as a semester group project. Through the guidance of Profs. Gil and Cordell, and the many contributions made by other DH scholars in the field, they spent the next three months developing a preliminary list of DH projects from around the globe and working through the platform of Scalar, began drafting interactive project narratives for the Around DH site.
