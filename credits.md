This project could not have been possible without the collaboration of an enormous amount of people. The final list is under construction. Before the end of the 80 days we will have a full list for you. In the meantime, we couldn't launch without at least acknowledging Ryan Cordell's class "Doing Digital Humanities"; the editors who have stepped up to make tough choices, Roopika Risam, Miriam Pe√±a Pimentel and Paul Arthur; our first designer, Susana Aho; the Global Outlook::Digital Humanities community and all the wonderful folks who contributed to the master list. 

Your names shall be sung to the four corners of the earth soon!
