This project could not have been possible without the collaboration of an enormous amount of people. First of all, special thanks to Ryan Cordell's class "Doing Digital Humanities" without whom this project would not have its wings; and to our early editors who stepped up to make tough choices before the project took off, Roopika Risam, Miriam Peña Pimentel and Paul Arthur; to our first designer, Susana Aho, who designed the coming soon page that kept us all waiting; to the Global Outlook::Digital Humanities community and all the wonderful folks who contributed to the master list during the months leading up to our launch. Last but not least, we thank all of you who have shared our tour with your friends. You would be happy to know we received visitors from all corners of the globe. 

Below is the complete list in order of appearance of all who have contributed to the daily posts, either by making the choices or editing the blurbs.
